This list of recipe is synced across all implementations of emoji meals.

## How to contribute

Add your recipe to [recipes.json](https://github.com/EmojiMeals/recipes/blob/master/recipes.json) by making a pull request. Please comment a youtube link or recipe link next to your recipe so we can share the knowledge.

## Testing

In order to make sure that we don't break the workflows of the millions of developers that use it, we made a simple CI check that ensures that there are no duplicate recipes and that the integrity of the json file is still valid.
